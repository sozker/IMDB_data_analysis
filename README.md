# IMDB data analysis

Data is downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com/

You can find the information on which dataset contains which values, you can check this page: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/


I made a point system based on number of votes and rating. I’ve selected top 500 movies according to that point system and made a visualization out of it.

You can find this visualization here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/sertac.ozker#!/vizhome/TopMoviesforIMDB/Dashboard1?publish=yes
